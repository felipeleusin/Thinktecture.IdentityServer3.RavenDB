# Thinktecture.IdentityServer3.RavenDB

Persistence layer for IndentityServer3 using RavenDB

## Disclaimer

This is very much a work in progress, i'm porting the code from Thinktecture.IdentityServer3.EntityFramework repository but so far much of the code is not needed since Raven can just store the Models from IdentityServer directly with some minor changes
